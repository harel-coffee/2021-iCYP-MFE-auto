## Motivation
The human cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily holds responsibilities for the
metabolism of both endogenous and exogenous compounds such as drugs, cellular
metabolites, and toxins. Inhibition of CYP450 isoforms is closely associated with
1adverse drug reactions which may cause metabolic failures and even induce serious
side effects. In modern drug discovery and development, identification of potential
CYP isoforms’ inhibitors is highly essential. Besides experimental approaches, numerous 
computational frameworks have been recently developed to address this biological
issue. In our study, we propose robust, stable, and effective prediction models for
the virtual screening of five CYP isoforms’ inhibitors, including CYP1A2, CYP2C9,
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. The method employs multitask learning combining with molecular 
fingerprint-embedded encoding to boost the predictive power.

## Results
Our results showed that multitask learning had remarkably leveraged useful information 
from related tasks to promote global performance. In comparison with several
state-of-the-art methods, our proposed method is outperforming in all tasks with the
highest area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (ROC-AUC) of
0.93 and area under the precision-recall (PR) curve (PR-AUC) of 0.92. The evaluated
performance once confirms our model’s robustness, stability, and efficiency.
